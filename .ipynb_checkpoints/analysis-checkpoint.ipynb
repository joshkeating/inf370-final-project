    "The purpose of this project is to identify the aspects of Airbnb host listings that have a correlation to the frequency of achieving bookings. This information will allow Airbnb hosts to find and improve certain variables of their listing that can increase their number of bookings. The dataset used was the Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle#calendar.csv). The two CSV files we are using from this set are calendar.csv and listings.csv. The calendar file displays the listing_id, the dates, whether it is available on that date, and the price of booking for that day. The listings file includes a wide variety of metadata scraped from the listing url.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the given columns in the dataset, we used the Microsoft Azure Text Sentiment Analysis API to calculate the sentiment value (on a scale of 1 - 100) of the listing summary. Positive and negative sentiment can be identified and perhaps has a correlation to number of bookings. This was done using post requests on Postman and is known as scores.csv. "
